# Check Top Largest Files

---

## Purpose

Actually...
I wrote this piece of code for one of my peers in college.
(He asked for it.)

And I think it's good to make it open source.

There might be great enhancement from the open source community :)

## Usage

Use `$python xTopLargest.py` to list the top 10.
Or use `$python xTopLargest.py <count>` to list the top `count` largest files.

## Installation

Just download it and run it.
It's simple, I know it. lol.
